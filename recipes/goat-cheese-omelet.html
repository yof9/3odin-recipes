            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This simple goat cheese omelet has few ingredients, but tons of flavor. You can use a flavored goat cheese such as garlic & herb, truffle, or tomato basil for an even greater flavor explosion.</p>
            <h3>Ingridents</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</li>
                <li>2 ounces plain goat cheese, crumbled</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, water, salt, and pepper until yolks and whites are completely combined and eggs are light and frothy, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into skillet and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just starting to set. Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let cook until just slightly underdone and shiny.
                     If necessary, move extra raw egg around to the edges of the skillet. Lower heat to medium-low to prevent browning, if necessary.</li>
                <li>Top middle of omelet with goat cheese and about 2 teaspoons of the chives. Fold one side over the cheese in the middle, followed by the other side, so the omelet is folded in thirds. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with remaining chives.</li>
            </ol>
